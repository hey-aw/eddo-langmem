Slide K and related science notebook entry


Formative
This is a good opportunity to determine if students can plan investigations in small groups without a lot of scaffolding. Slide K cues students to start planning their investigation with their group. You can assess much of this plan before groups go to carry out the investigation and collect the data from it. Look for
identification of a single independent variable
identification of the dependent variables
identification of important variables to keep constant
a data table with results from at least two conditions tested
peak forces measurements and/or equalities or inequalities noted for both push-pull spring scales for each condition tested
results from repeated trials for each condition (optional)
source(s) of error in the system (optional)


1.A Develop a model to describe interactions between two objects as they collide and show the changes that occur in the structure of both objects when one object is damaged as a result and also when neither object is damaged as a result.

1.B Ask questions that arise from observations of collisions between two objects in order to seek additional information about factors (causes) that might affect the outcome of such collisions.
1.A Developing and Using Models; Stability and Change; Systems and System Models
When to check for understanding: Collect students’ initial models on Initial Model: Objects During Collisions and explanations on Object Interactions During A Collision at the end of day 1 to pre-assess their fluency in developing a model.
What to look for/listen for: Prompts in this task ask students to engage in two elements of the modeling practice related to representing descriptive aspects of the phenomenon as well as unobservable mechanisms. These will provide an opportunity for students to use related DCIs from prior grades; grade 4 (energy transfer in collisions) and grade 2 (objects push each other when they collide). There are phrases in the prompts that ask students to consider related elements of CCCs, particularly systems and system models and stability and change. You may also see some students developing particle-level representations for changes happening in the matter in the system, based on their extensive work in developing such models in prior OpenSciEd units. See the related Assessment callout box for additional guidance.

1.B Asking Questions and Defining Problems; Cause and Effect
When to check for understanding: Since students will put their initials on the backs of these sticky notes, you will have a few opportunities to take stock of the kinds of questions students ask in this initial lesson after they are posted on the DQB as well as when they first write them. When students share these questions for the DQB, they will likely have time to share only one. Collect the remaining questions that don’t get posted after the development of the DQB is complete. This record of questions they form today will help you formatively assess their fluency in the practice of asking questions at the start of this year. Collect and look through student notebooks to see their individual ideas for future investigations to pursue as well.
What to look for/listen for: See the related Assessment callout box for additional guidance.
